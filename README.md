Hi this is my scooter searching application. 
The database stores scooter coordinates. 
The backend provides data to the front end for plotting the closest x scooters within y meters of a given lat, lon. 
The front end allows the users to set 
1. Lon
2. Lat
3. Y metres
4. X scooters
The data is plotted on a map, which defaults to center around Botanic Gardens.

This project uses the MERN stack (Mongodb, Express, React, Node).
